9/5/20, 3:49 PM - Er. Pratyush: ok
9/5/20, 4:29 PM - +91 98200 64197: Good thoughts Pratyush. Also think of the time needed to build from scratch as well as time taken to make basic changes using an in house CMS rather than using a CMS platform like Wordpress, and compare all options.
9/5/20, 5:22 PM - Er. Pratyush: if all are comfortable with php/html it will take one month to complete all stuff
9/5/20, 6:30 PM - +91 98200 64197: Too long. We shall use Wordpress platform to build the website, then. Simple. And for the rest of the development, tech stack is different, will share and discuss. Doctor and Patient platforms will have links from the main website.
